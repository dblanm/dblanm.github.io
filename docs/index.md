Hi there! I'm David Blanco Mulero, PhD Candidate at Aalto University [Intelligent Robotics group](https://irobotics.aalto.fi/)
supervised by Prof. Ville Kyrki.

My research focuses on data-efficient learning and robotic manipulation.

<br />

## Research interests
- **Geometric deep learning**. Relational inductive-bias models such as *Graph Neural Networks* or *Graph Gaussian Processes*.
- **Gaussian processes**. Probabilistic models on structured domains. Learning data-efficient surrogate models for control.
- **Manipulation**. Robotic manipulation of deformable objects.

I am also a Teaching Assistant for
the [Reinforcement Learning course](https://mycourses.aalto.fi/course/view.php?id=28593) at Aalto University.

## News


**10.09.2021** - We just submitted our work on [Closing the Sim2Real Gap in Dynamic Cloth Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.04771) to IEEE for possible publication.

**24.07.2021** - I had a really great time at the Time Series Workshop at ICML 2021! You can find the poster of my work [here](https://dblanm.github.io/assets/images/eGGP_poster.png).

**28.06.2021** - Our work [Evolving Graph Gaussian Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15127) was accepted 
to the [Time Series Workshop](http://roseyu.com/time-series-workshop/) at ICML 2021. See you there!
