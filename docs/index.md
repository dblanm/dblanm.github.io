Hi there! I'm David Blanco Mulero, PhD Candidate at Aalto University [Intelligent Robotics group](https://irobotics.aalto.fi/)
supervised by Prof. Ville Kyrki.

My research focuses on deformable object manipulation and learning representation for manipulation.

<br/>

## Research interests
- **Manipulation**. Robotic manipulation of deformable objects.
- **Geometric deep learning**. Relational inductive-bias models such as *Graph Neural Networks* or *Graph Gaussian Processes*.
- **Gaussian processes**. Probabilistic models on structured domains. Learning data-efficient surrogate models for control.


I am also a Teaching Assistant for
the [Reinforcement Learning course](https://mycourses.aalto.fi/course/view.php?id=28593) at Aalto University.
