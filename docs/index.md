Hi there! I'm David Blanco Mulero, currently a Researcher at [Institut de Robòtica i Informàtica Industrial](https://www.iri.upc.edu/) (IRI-CSIC-UPC).

I'm also about to finish my PhD at Aalto University [Intelligent Robotics group](https://irobotics.aalto.fi/)
supervised by Prof. Ville Kyrki.

My research focuses mainly on deformable object manipulation and learning representation for manipulation.

<br/>

## Research interests
- **Manipulation**. Robotic manipulation of deformable objects.
- **Geometric deep learning**. Relational inductive-bias models such as *Graph Neural Networks* or *Graph Gaussian Processes*.
- **Gaussian processes**. Probabilistic models on structured domains. Learning data-efficient surrogate models for control.

## News
**08.01.2024** - Really exciting news! I just started a Research position at [Institut de Robòtica i Informàtica Industrial](https://www.iri.upc.edu/) (IRI-CSIC-UPC).

**20.10.2023** - I was granted the [Nokia PhD Scholarship](https://nokiafoundation.com/grants/nokia-scholarship/) grant
(5000 Euros), to encourage the research of my PhD thesis.

**15.10.2023** - We have published a pre-print "[Benchmarking the Sim-to-Real Gap in Cloth Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09543)". This work presents a benchmark dataset for dynamic cloth manipulation, and evaluates the reality gap in MuJoCo, Bullet, Flex and SOFA using the proposed benchmark.
