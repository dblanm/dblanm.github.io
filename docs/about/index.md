My name is David Blanco Mulero and I'm a 3rd year Phd Student 
at Aalto University [Intelligent Robotics group](https://irobotics.aalto.fi/).


I received my MSc in Automation and Robotics at the Universidad Politecnica de Madrid (Spain).
I did my  MSc Thesis at CERN (2016), where I worked developing a [collision avoidance system](https://doi.org/10.1145/3068796.3068800) 
for the robotic platform [CERNTAURO](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8391705).

After that, I worked at CERN as a Technical student (2017-2018) in the EN-STI-ECE group (currently EN-SMM-MRO).
During that time I worked on SLAM techniques for performing visual inspection in the accelerators.
I also worked on developing a new mobile robotic platform as well as performing interventions in the accelerators.

In 2018 I joined Dyson algorithm's team. 
During my year at Dyson I continued working on topics related to autonomous navigation and mobile robotic platforms.
That year Dyson released the [Dyson 360 Heurist](https://www.dyson.co.uk/smart-home/smart-robot-vacuum), 
which is one of the projects I worked on.

After my time in industry and working close to research, I decided to step up and move to Academia.
I started at Aalto University as a Research Assistant (2019) to continue as a PhD Candidate.
My PhD is funded by the AI Spider Silk Threading (ASSET) project. 
The project goal is to mimic the natural spider pultrusion process 
via robotic micro-manipulation and reinforcement learning.


On my free time, aside of electronic and ML projects, I really enjoy bouldering.
I started bouldering on 2019 and I'm currently targeting a 6-C.

Here a photo of one of my 6-A successes :)
